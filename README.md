# 🎮 TinkerFlow

TinkerFlow is a High-Level Node Editor. Unlike Blueprint like systems it works with Abstract Steps and Behaviors, where you define "Move Object there" or "Highlight object".

It is based on [VR-Builder](https://github.com/MindPort-GmbH/VR-Builder) Framework or more the [VR-Builder-Lite](https://github.com/Sythelux/VR-Builder-Lite) Fork (without the VR features and Package Manager).
